# Usage Guidelines
implementation_guidelines:
  development:
    - "All MMs must follow YAML schema defined in MM-RAAS template"
    - "Dependencies must be explicitly declared and documented"
    - "Integration points must be clearly specified"
    - "Version control follows semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)"

  deployment:
    - "Active status requires full testing and documentation"
    - "Cross-integrations must be validated before production deployment"
    - "Registry updates require council review for critical/high priority modules"

  deprecation:
    - "6-month notice required for deprecating active modules"
    - "Migration path must be provided for deprecated modules"
    - "Dependencies must be updated before deprecation"

title: "Ritual-as-a-Service (RaaS)"
version: "1.0"
category: "Monetization Framework"

purpose: |
  Define Ritual-as-a-Service (RaaS) as the hybrid monetization model that bridges 
  symbolic operations with practical business outcomes. RaaS transforms traditional 
  software delivery into experiential engagements that combine AI-powered tools, 
  ritual frameworks, and community-driven value creation.

description: |
  RaaS represents a paradigm shift from tool-based to experience-based service 
  delivery. It integrates Software-as-a-Service efficiency with symbolic ritual 
  practices to create meaningful, transformative user experiences that generate 
  sustainable revenue through multiple value streams.
